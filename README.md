# Programming-Experiment-1
### Experiment 1 is all about creating a function that changes and returns the string.

## How It's Made
### This programming assignment wade made in the jupyter notebook and phyton. 

### In example 1, it defines a function that sorts the characters of a given string alphabetically and returns the sorted string. The function is then tested with the "HACKER" string, and the sorted result is printed alphabetically.

### In example 2, The provided Python code is intended to improve written communication by adding matching emoticons to sentences in place of certain words. To accomplish this, the software makes good use of Python's data structures and string manipulation features. The program's entry point is the main function. The user is asked to enter a sentence, which is then used to apply the replace function. The resultant sentence is then printed with emoticons.

### In example 3, A list of numbers can be divided into three sections using the provided Python code: the first element, the middle element, and the last element. A list of numbers is defined first. The list is then split into three variables—first, which contains the first element. Middle, which contains the middle elements and final, which contains the last element. Lastly, the program prints out the values of these variables.
